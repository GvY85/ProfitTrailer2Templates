# ProfitTrailer2Templates
A set of ProfitTrailer 2 settings templates to help ease migration from PT1.x to PT2

The idea is that you can open these settings templates side by side with your current PT1.x settings to speed up migration from PT1.x to PT2.

In the future I want to add explainatory comments to them, mark mandatory and optional settings and perhaps even share my settings.

Like some crazy dude likes to say: it will be amazing, it will be great, it will be the best thing ever, stay tuned ;).
